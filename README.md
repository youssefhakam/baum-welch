# Baum-Welch Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models

This code implements the Baum-Welch algorithm for learning and calibrating a hidden Markov model. The purpose of this algorithm is to refine the transition and observation matrices based on an input observation sequence and initial distribution.

## Input:

The algorithm requires the following inputs:

1. **V**: Observation sequence matrix for your data.
2. **Transition matrix**: Initial transition matrix.
3. **Observation matrix (B)**: Initial observation matrix.
4. **Initial distribution**: Initial distribution of states.

## Output:

The algorithm provides the following calibrated matrices as output:

1. Calibrated transition matrix.
2. Calibrated observation matrix.
3. Calibrated initial distribution.

## How to Use:

1. Provide your observation sequence matrix (**V**).
2. Initialize the transition matrix, observation matrix, and initial distribution.
3. Run the Baum-Welch algorithm using the provided code.
4. The algorithm will output the calibrated transition matrix, observation matrix, and initial distribution.

Happy calibrating! ðŸŒŸ
